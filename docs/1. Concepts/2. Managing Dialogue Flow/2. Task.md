# Task

Neureca helps you to implement each task in the dialogue flow. All you need to do is create a class that inherits from `neureca.dialogue_manager.Task` and implement two metods: `start` and `apply`. For example, let's see how we implement Greeting task.

```python
from neureca.dialogue_manager import Task


class Greeting(Task):

    def start(self, user_belief):
        response = f"NeuercaðŸ’¡ here! How's your day, {user_belief.user_name}?"
        return response

    def apply(self, text, user_belief):
        if text.intent == "GREETING" or text.intent == "POSITIVE":
            response = "OK cool, I'll give you spot on recommendations!"
            self.complete_task()

        elif text.intent == "ASK_PLACE_RECOMMENDATION":
            user_belief.update_attributes(text.attributes)

            if user_belief.has_attribute("occation"):
                occasion = user_belief.get_attribute_value("occasion")
                response = f"OK, I'll recommend you some cool restaurnts for {occasion}."

            else:
                response = "OK cool, I'll give you spot on recommendations!"

            self.complete_task()

        else:
            # fallback
            response = "Couldn't get what you mean... How's your day?"

        return response
```
## start
```python 
def start(self, user_belief:UserBelief) -> str
```
This method outputs the assistant's utterance when the task starts. As an input argument it receives an instance of `UserBelief` class that contains the information of user. you can use `UserBelief`'s API to obtain user's information. The UserBelief API is described here.

## apply
```python 
def apply(self, text:NLUOutput, user_belief:UserBelief) -> str
```
This method outputs the assistant's response given the user's utterence. `NLUOutput` instance contains the information of user's utterance. You can update `user_belief` and choose the next utterance. 

When the task completes successfully, it calls the `self.complete_task()` method to notify the dialog manager that it should move on to the next task.
