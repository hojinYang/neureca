# NLU Data


NLU(Natural Language Understanding) data is used to train NeurecaðŸ’¡'s NLU model. Specifically, the NLU model consists of an intent classifier and an attribute recognizer, and NLU Data is used to generate sentence examples to train each model.

Similar to attribute data, NeurecaðŸ’¡ uses YAML to manage NLU data. For example, let's see how to configure `nlu.yaml`.

```
#nlu.yaml

nlu:
- intent: ASK_PLACE_RECOMMENDATION
  examples: 
    - Can you recommend some cool place?
    - Do you have other recommendations?
    - Do you know other place with [parking]{parking}?
    - I am looking for [*]{food_type} restaurant with [patio]{patio}
    - I'm looking for a place for [dinner/lunch/brunch/breakfast]{occasion} in [*]{location}.

- intent: PROVIDE_PREFERENCE
  examples:
    - you know, [*]{food_type} food is always right.
    - i'm always down for [*]{food_type}

- intent: ASK_QUESTION
  examples: 
    - Do they have [parking]{parking} spot?
    - I'm thinking about moving with my car.. do they have [parking]{parking}?
    - Is there any [*]{food_type} menu?
```
In the example above, you can see that intents and examples of sentences for each intent are included.

as you can see in the example, you need to provide intent and its example. And in each example, you can create various sentences using the attribute specified in `attribute.yaml`. 

Here are some rules: 
```
[sub_attr]{attr}
[sub_attr1/sub_attr2/...]{attr}
```
The above line means that synonyms of the specified `sub_attr` of `attr` can be placed in the corresponding position in a sentence.
```
[*]{attr}
```
The above line means that every `sub_attr` of `attr` can be placed in the corresponding position in a sentence.

If there is no sub_att in attr, then specify as follow:
```
[attr]{attr}
```

NLU data is used to train two sub-models of NLU: `Intent Classifier` and `Attribute Tecognizer`. `Intent Classifier` is trained to classify the intent of a given sentence.  `attribute recognizer` is trained to extract attributes in a given sentence.
