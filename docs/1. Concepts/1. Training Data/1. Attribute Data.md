# Attribute Data

The first step required to create your own conversational assistant is to provide attribute data. This data lists the set of properties(attributes) that an item can have. 

NeurecaðŸ’¡ uses YAML to manage attribute data. Let's see how to configure `attribute.yaml` through an example.

```
#attribute.yaml
attribute:
- attr: patio
  syn: [patio, patios]

- attr: parking
  syn: [parking, parking lot, p lot, street parking]
  
- attr: occasion
  sub-attr:
  - attr: breakfast
    syn: [breakfast, breakfasts]
  - attr: lunch

- attr: food_type
  sub-attr:
  - attr: burger
    syn: [burger, burgers, hamburger, hambergers]
  - attr: cafe
    syn: [cafe, cafes, cafeteria, cafeteriastyle, coffee]

- attr: location
  sub-attr:
  - attr: alexandra park
    syn: [alexandra park]
  - attr: annex
    syn: [annex]

- attr: place_name
  is_item: True
```
In the example above, you can see that we can specify the attributes as follow:
```
- attr: attrirbute_name
  syn: [synonym-1, synonym-2, ...]
```

If an attribute has a sub-attribute, it can be specified using `sub-attr`. 
```
  - attr: 
    sub-attr:
    - attr: breakfast
      syn: [breakfast, morning meal]
    - attr: group
      syn: [group gathering, group table, group dining]
    - attr: family
      syn: [family dinner, family restaurants]
```
Attribut names in `attribute.yaml`  are used as variables in NLU data, which will be explained later to generate sentence examples.

Last but not least, you need to define the item name variable to be used when generating a sentence examples.  `is_item: True` indicates that it is an item name variable.

```
- attr: place_name
  is_item: True
```
