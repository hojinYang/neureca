# <center>Neureca💡 for Conversational Recommender System</center>

This repository contains source code for Neureca project. Neureca is a framework for building conversational recommender system. It is also an open-source project that helps any ML researchers develop ConvRec system and contribute to key components easily.


- Neureca is still under developing phase: the timeline for the demo of verion 0.0X would be around late May - early June.
- At this moment, I set Neureca repository as a personal repo under my github account. I'll transfer this repo to another orgnaization github(either D3M or independent org only for this project) in the future when development has progressed to some extent. 
- Neureca is temporarily named(as an acronym for NEUral REcommender for Conversational Assistant). Please let me know if you have any other good ideas!
